# Amayshop
Amayshop is a shopping cart exercise implementation. I use TDD to complete the exercise. I use Single Responsibility principle by extracting the implimentation from ShoppingCart class. You will find some convenience methods in ShoppingCart. I hope the namings are descriptive as possible. The Execution of the scenarios will be coming from the Unit Tests.
